 abstract = {We develop a new approach to solving minimum-cost circulation problems. Our approach combines methods for solving the maximum flow problem with successive approximation techniques based on cost scaling. We measure the accuracy of a solution by the amount that the complementary slackness conditions are violated. We propose a simple minimum-cost circulation algorithm, one version of which runs in <tex-math>$O(n^{3}{\rm log}(nC))$</tex-math> time on an n-vertex network with integer arc costs of absolute value at most C. By incorporating sophisticated data structures into the algorithm, we obtain a time bound of <tex-math>$O(nm\ {\rm log}(n^{2}/m){\rm log}(nC))$</tex-math> on a network with m arcs. A slightly different use of our approach shows that a minimum-cost circulation can be computed by solving a sequence of O(n log(nC)) blocking flow problems. A corollary of this result is an <tex-math>$O(n^{2}({\rm log}n){\rm log}(nC))\text{-time}$</tex-math>, m-processor parallel minimum-cost circulation algorithm. Our approach also yields strongly polynomial minimum-cost circulation algorithms. Our results provide evidence that the minimum-cost circulation problem is not much harder than the maximum flow problem. We believe that a suitable implementation of our method will perform extremely well in practice.},

Under the practical assumption that U is polynomially bounded in n, our algorithm runs in time O(nm+n<sup>2</sup>log n). This result improves the previous best bound of O(nm log (n<sup>2</sup>/m)), obtained by Goldberg and Tarjan, by a factor of log n for networks that are both nonsparse and nondense without using any complex data structures. We also describe a parallel implementation of the algorithm that runs in O(n<sup>2</sup>log U log p) time in the PRAM model with EREW and uses only p processors where p = [m/n].},
